hi!

This is one of many other way to convert DXF file to KML
This soft will convert all lines and polylines form a CAD(dxf) file into red lines in KML
This script can be improved in so many ways, depending on the need of every person
Main library used in this script is GDAL

YES, I had created this app with the help of AI(Chat GPT and Microsoft Copilot)

If this app will give you red lines over the globe you can try to choose another EPSG
or to change units for your CAD file(using "units" comand in autocad for example)
